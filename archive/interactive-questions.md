# Interactive Questions for Audience Engagement

## Suggested Placement in Slides:

### Opening Slide (after the motivation story)
**Add after the wife story:**
"Quick show of hands - who here has had that moment where you actually trusted an AI coding tool to do something important?"

### Act II: Bronze Age Slide (after listing the hype)
**Add after the hype list:**
"Be honest - how many of you have fallen down at least one of these Reddit AI rabbit holes? Don't worry, we've all been there."

### Act III: The 4AM Marathon slide
**Add after explaining the marathons:**
"Raise your hand if you've ever had a coding session that felt like pure flow - where time just disappeared. That's what we're chasing."

### Before the Final Slide
**Add a new interactive closing:**
"Before I wrap up - what's the one thing you're working on right now that actually matters to you? Not just another app, but something that would make a real difference?"

## Implementation in Slidev:

```markdown
<v-click>

<div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4">
<strong>Quick show of hands:</strong> Who here has had that moment where you actually trusted an AI coding tool to do something important?
</div>

</v-click>
```

These questions:
1. Create immediate engagement
2. Make people reflect on their own experience
3. Build shared understanding
4. Lead naturally into your next point
5. Keep the energy interactive rather than just presentational
