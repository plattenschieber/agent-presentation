### **The Individual Pattern**
- `brainstorm.md` → Raw thoughts
- `spec.md` → Clear requirements
- `tasks.md` → Actionable steps
- Clean context + focused sessions
- Rails convention over configuration

</div>

<div>

### **The Systematic Approach**
- **Omakase Philosophy**: Opinionated defaults
- **Convention-Driven**: Less decisions = more focus
- **Intent-Preserved**: Every choice documented
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build → Learn → Improve
- **Context-Aware**: Right tool, right job

</div>

</div>

**Result**: What took weeks now takes hours - not just for me, but for any builder

This version focuses more on:
- The methodology scaling from personal to systematic
- The core principles rather than specific products
- The "why" behind the approach
- How others can apply the same thinking

Should I replace the current Omaverse slide with this version, or do you prefer the product-focused one?
