Hey!

Thanks for coming to Claude Code Anonymous tonight! ðŸš€

Hope you enjoyed the lightning talks and discussions. The honest experiences shared really made it valuable for everyone.

**Quick feedback** (takes 30 seconds):
- What was your biggest takeaway?
- Which lightning talk resonated most?
- Any tools you want to try now?
- Should we do this again?

Just hit reply with your thoughts - or don't, totally fine either way!

Also, feel free to connect with other attendees if you want to continue the conversation about agentic coding tools.

Thanks again for making it a great evening!

Cheers,
[Your name]

P.S. If you have any cool experiments with AI coding tools in the coming weeks, we'd love to hear about them at the next meetup ðŸ‘€
