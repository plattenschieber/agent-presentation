# LinkedIn Post - Claude Code Anonymous Round 2

Claude Sonnet 4.5 dropped 2 hours ago.

77.2% on SWE-bench Verified.
30+ hours of focused execution.
The world's best coding model is here.

Perfect timing for Round 2 of Claude Code Anonymous ðŸ’’ Cologne Edition.

Round 1 was electric - technical discussions ran until 10pm. Builders sharing real patterns, real failures, real breakthroughs in agentic coding. No bullshit. No slides full of theory. Just practitioners who are deep in the trenches.

**We're opening 50 seats for Round 2.**

October 21, 2025 | Cologne | 18:00-20:30

Same safe-space format:
â€¢ No recordings, no live streams
â€¢ What's said in the room, stays in the room
â€¢ Lightning talks from participants (5 min max)
â€¢ Open discussions about what actually works

**Want in?**

Comment "interested" below
Add one real challenge or insight from your agentic coding work (the more specific, the better)

I'll DM selected folks with location details and access.

This is for builders already shipping with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, or similar tools. If you're experimenting in production, debugging agent behaviors, or have war stories to share - this is your crowd.

Let's ride this Sonnet 4.5 wave together. ðŸš€
