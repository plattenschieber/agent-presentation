Cologne's developers are invited to join Claude Code Anonymous, a meetup designed for those navigating the exciting, and sometimes challenging, shift to agentic coding.

Are you experimenting with tools like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor CLI, or even your own custom agents? Are you actively integrating them into your workflow? Then this meetup is for you!

Our mission in Cologne is to create an open forum for developers. No hype, just real talk about what's working, what's not, and how agentic coding is changing the job.

Got a story? We're looking for 5 minute lightning talks about your experiences on the front lines. Share the wins, the fails, and the facepalms. Whether an agent saved your sprint or deleted your database, we want the details.

This is a space for honest conversation. To make that happen, nothing is recorded or live-streamed. What's said in the room, stays in the room.

Schedule:





18:00 - Arrive, get-together



18:45 - Intro and lightning talks



19:45 - Wrap-up and open discussion



20:30 - Venue

Call for Speakers! We currently have a few lightning talk slots available. If you'd like to share your experiences, please reach out to Jeronim! (Optional: Please include your GitHub handle for guest vetting purposes.)
