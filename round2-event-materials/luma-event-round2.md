# Claude Code Anonymous ðŸ’’ Cologne Edition - Round 2

## Event Description

**Claude Sonnet 4.5 just dropped. 77.2% on SWE-bench. 30+ hours of focused coding. The world's best coding model is here.**

After Round 1's electric discussions that ran until 10pm, we're opening 50 seats for technical builders who are already deep in the agentic coding trenches.

This is Claude Code Anonymous - a safe space for honest, unfiltered technical conversations about building with AI coding agents.

**What makes this different:**
- Nothing is recorded or live-streamed
- What's said in the room, stays in the room
- Only builders with real hands-on experience
- Lightning talks from participants (5 min, 1-2 slides)
- Open discussions about what actually works (and what doesn't)

**Format:**
- 18:00 - Arrive and get-together
- 18:45 - Intro and lightning talks
- 19:45 - Wrap-up and open discussion
- 20:30 - Venue concludes

**Who should apply:**
Developers, founders, engineers actively building with agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, etc.) who have real stories, patterns, and pitfalls to share.

**Location:**
Cologne, Germany (exact address shared after admission)

**Admission:**
Application required. Selected participants will receive location details and event access.
